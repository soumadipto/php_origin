# Simple PHP Website

I put together this project while introducing a friend of mine to PHP. I decided to clean it up a bit and put it on Github so anyone new to PHP can have a taste of a **very simple and minimal** website built with PHP.


## Usage

I've made sure to make the running of this little site as simple as possible. There are only to steps go take:

1. Download the project to the desired directory on your computer
2. Populate the `site_url` field in `includes/config.php` with the desird site url.

## Concepts

The project covers these programming concepts:

 * Variables
 * Arrays
 * Functions
 * Pretty links *(/about) with fallback to query string (?page=about)*
 * Basic example of separation of concerns *(functionality, template, content)*
