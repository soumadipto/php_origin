<p>OpenShift is a family of <b>containerization</b> software developed by Red Hat. Its flagship product is the OpenShift Container Platformâ€”an on-premises platform as a service built around Docker containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The family's other products provide this platform through different environments: OKD serves as the community-driven upstream (akin to CentOS), OpenShift Online is the platform offered as software as a service, and Openshift Dedicated is the platform offered as a managed service.</p>
</p>OpenShift originally came from Red Hat's acquisition of Makara - a company with a proprietary PaaS solution[5]based on Linux containers[6]. Even though OpenShift was announced in May 2011, it was proprietary technology and did not become open-source until May of 2012[7]. Up until v3, the container technology and container orchestration technology used custom developed technologies. This changed in v3 with the adoption of Docker as the container technology, and Kubernetes as the container orchestration technology[8]. The v4 product has many other architectural changes - a prominent one being a shift to using CRIO[9] as the container runtime, and Buildah as the container build tool[10], thus breaking the exclusive dependency on Docker.</p>
