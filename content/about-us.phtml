<p><b>OpenShift</b>is RedHat's cloud development Platform as a Service (PaaS). The free and open source cloud-based platform allows developers to create, test and run their applications and deploy them to the cloud.</p>
</p>OpenShift provides support for Node.js, Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl, and Java and is extensible so that users can add support for other languages. Resources allocated for applications can be automatically or manually scaled so that as demand increases there is no degradation of performance. OpenShift provides portability through the DeltaCloud API so customers can migrate deployments to other cloud computing vendor environments.</p>
